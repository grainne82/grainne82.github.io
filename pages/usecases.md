# Business Use Cases
Learn about some of the most common use cases for our API.

## Use Case 1: Transaction Management
With our API you can schedule transactions to flow automatically from your chosen EPOS into AIQ. Transactions can be of any type, including invoices, sales, receipts, and allocations. You can also bring in settlement receipts such as cash, credit, or loyalty cards. Within AIQ, our API then lets you settle these receipts with bank accounts.

Any business, especially those with high volumes of sales, can benefit from this type of integration. Entering data once and allowing the API to update it elsewhere allows for significant gains in both efficiency and the accuracy of your data.

### Integration Partner Example:
Our integration with Salesforce lets you create sales orders based on closed opportunities within their system. The integration works both ways. Payments taken via Salesforce pass to AIQ. In addition, sales staff can access customer balances and statuses added by the finance team, meaning everyone has the most up-to-date records.

## Use Case 2: Business Analysis
Integrating with sophisticated business analysis software can help any company better understand their financial position. Use our API to pull data from AIQ into your preferred analysis software to produce live dashboards, enhanced with your business line data. 

Viewing all your relevant data in one place, broken down according to your industry’s requirements, will give you a better picture of where your company is at performance-wise. You can then use this information to strategise about all relevant aspects of your business, saving you time and money.

### Integration Partner Example:
Users of Oracle’s Opera, a hospitality management system, who integrate with AIQ can pull invoices from AIQ into Opera, gaining invaluable business management data. For example, income can be broken down by rooms, conference facilities, or food and drinks.

## Use Case 3: Tax and Payroll Automation
Use our API to assist you with your routine business obligations, from tax obligations, to managing your payroll, and more. With API automation, you can ensure that your business runs smoothly and stays compliant, as well as save time.

With the advent of Making Tax Digital, APIs are now central to the tax and VAT return process. Reduce the burden of tax reporting by submitting financial information from AIQ to HMRC in one easy move. 

You can also minimise payroll administration by integrating a specialised third-party system with AIQ. The payroll system can be set up to pull the appropriate employee details from the AIQ accounts.

### Integration Partner Example:
Our integration with BrightPay lets you automate the payroll process by mapping each payroll item to the relevant account. You can manage the payroll, automate payments including tax calculations, publish payslips, and more.

## Use Case 4: Approval Management
Enjoy a smoother expenses approval process by integrating your existing process with AIQ. Any documents you upload to your preferred third-party approval system can then automatically flow into AIQ. In AIQ the data is then extracted which sets off the pre-defined approval process. 

Using APIs to automate approval will save you a significant amount of administration time, ensure all records are in agreement, and eliminate the need for physical paperwork.

### Integration Partner Example:
Our Expensify integration lets you photograph, upload, and record expenses in their application, then pulls the data into AIQ to complete the process.

## Use Case 5: Work/Project Management
Integrations let you simplify the otherwise complex process of business management, both in terms of manual administration and decision making. When you integrate your management software with AIQ, you can directly relate your financial data to your work and project goals. 

Data can flow between systems, so you always have the most up-to-data data available. Plan workflows so that your timesheets fit within your budget goals. 

### Integration Partner Example:
The integration between AccountsIQ and Joblogic allows an easier and more efficient way to manage finances, combining the benefits of both an accounting system and a powerful service management software.
