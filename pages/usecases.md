# Business Use Cases
## Use Case 1: Business Analysis
Use AIQ accounting data to produce live dashboards, enhanced with your business line data. Viewing all your relevant data in one place, broken down according to your industry’s requirements, gives you a better picture of where your company is at performance-wise. You can then use this information to strategize about all relevant aspects of your business, saving you time and money.

**Example:** Users of Oracle’s Opera, a hospitality management system, who integrate with AIQ can pull invoices from AIQ in Opera, gaining invaluable business management data. Income can be broken down by rooms, conference facilities, or food and drinks.

## Use Case 2: Transaction Management
Use the AIQ API to synchronise any of your payment records such as invoices or receipts with a third-party system. You could set up end-of-day sales records from the EPOS to flow automatically into the AIQ system, along with the settlement receipts (cash, credit, or loyalty cards). With our API you can let third-party payment systems handle online payments, including payment schedules without leaving AIQ.

**Example:** Our integration with Salesforce lets you create sales orders based on closed opportunities within Salesforce. Payments taken via Salesforce pass to AIQ. The integration works both ways, allowing sales staff to access customer balances and statuses added by the finance team.

## Use Case 3: Managerial Accounting
Use our API to assist you with your routine business obligations, from tax compliance, to paying your staff. With the advent of Making Tax Digital, APIs are now central to the tax and VAT return process. Reduce the burden of tax reporting by submitting financial information to HMRC in one easy move. By automating payroll management, you don’t need to worry about handling staff payments each month. Automate the process, including complex tax calculations.

**Example:** Our integration with BrightPay lets you automate the payroll process by mapping each payroll item to the relevant account. You can manage the payroll, automate payment including tax calculations, publish payslips and more.

In the era of PSD2 and open banking, APIs are helping to shape a genuinely revolutionary new way of working in the financial sector. With the advent of Making Tax Digital, APIs will be at the heart of the tax and VAT return process, allowing financial information from third-party software (including AccountsIQ) to be submitted to HMRC in one easy move.

## Use Case 4: Approval Management
Enjoy a smoother expenses approval process by integrating your existing processes with AIQ. Our API can automate and synchronise the approval process, taking the headache out of approval. By integrating your approval system with AIQ, any financial documents you upload to a third-party system, automatically flow into AIQ. This will save you a significant amount of processing time.

**Example:** Our Expensify integration allows you to photograph, upload and record expenses feeding directly into the accounting system. AP automation will allow you to extract the posting data and send the approval journey prior to automated payment. Receipt tracking and expense management, VAT allocation, photograph, upload, and record expenses, feeds directly into AIQ and sets off approval.

## Use Case 5: Work and Project Management
When you integrate your management software with AIQ, you can directly relate your financial data to your work and project goals. Data can flow between systems, so you always have the most up-to-data data available. Plan workflows so that your timesheets fit within your budget goals. Integrations let you simplify the otherwise complex process of business management, both in terms of manual administration and decision making.

**Example:** The integration between AccountsIQ and Joblogic allows an easier and more efficient way to manage finances, combining the benefits of both an accounting system and a powerful service management software.
