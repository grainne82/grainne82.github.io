## GENERAL ADVANTAGES

### EFFICIENT
Our API can significantly increase the efficiency of your existing business processes. Instead of entering the same data in multiple systems, enter it once and let our API do the work for you. Free up the time your employees spend on repetitive and potentially dull tasks and let them focus on more satisfying and high value work. 

### FLEXIBLE
APIs open up a more flexible way of working. You are not confined to one way of working as you can tailor things to meet your needs. How you share data between systems can be customised to meet your specific business needs. Data can be shared in one direction or both. The type of data you can access can be tailored to meet the needs of your sector, or preferred manner of business organisation.

### ACCURACY
Gain greater control over the accuracy of your data. Maintaining accurate data is fundamental to the success of any business. When your business processes involve multiple individuals entering data into multiple systems, it’s easy for inaccuracies to sneak in. By using APIs to eliminate data re-entry, you can prevent inconsistencies between records. Regular synchronisation routines ensure that the data in up to date.

## Advantages for Developers
- **Knowledge Sharing:** It’s easy to integrate with third-party systems because developers share knowledge. AccountsIQ has an open API strategy, meaning that anyone can write software that is compatible with our system and each time we create an integration with a development partner, it’s available for everyone. The more people that use our services, the more this knowledge base grows.
- **Flexible Development:** It’s flexible to develop with. AIQ API can be used with any programming language and platform so be adapted to meet the preferred processes of your development team.
- **Quicker Development Time:** It saves developers time as they don’t have to build a solution from scratch. Instead, they can employ our specialised readymade solutions. For more specific business needs, developers can then use our product as a base for further development.
- **More efficient software:** It can help developers create more efficient products. Instead of creating overly complex products, with features that slow it down, developers can let our API handle that complexity in the background. 
- **Ease of Maintenance:** It’s easier to maintain. By not developing your own product, your developers also don’t need to maintain any updates. As we improve our products, you will receive the benefits.
- **Scalable Solutions:** It’s scalable.

## BUSINESS USE CASES
### USE CASE 1: BUSINESS ANALYSIS
Use AIQ accounting data to produce live dashboards, enhanced with your business line data. Viewing all your relevant data in one place, broken down according to your industry’s requirements, gives you a better picture of where your company is at performance-wise. You can then use this information to strategize about all relevant aspects of your business, saving you time and money.

**Example:** Users of Oracle’s Opera, a hospitality management system, who integrate with AIQ can pull invoices from AIQ in Opera, gaining invaluable business management data. Income can be broken down by rooms, conference facilities, or food and drinks.

### USE CASE 2: MANAGING TRANSACTIONS
Use the AIQ API to synchronise any of your payment records such as invoices or receipts with a third-party system. You could set up end-of-day sales records from the EPOS to flow automatically into the AIQ system, along with the settlement receipts (cash, credit, or loyalty cards). With our API you can let third-party payment systems handle online payments, including payment schedules without leaving AIQ.

**Example:** Our integration with Salesforce lets you create sales orders based on closed opportunities within Salesforce. Payments taken via Salesforce pass to AIQ. The integration works both ways, allowing sales staff to access customer balances and statuses added by the finance team.

### USE CASE 3: BUSINESS FINANCE
Use our API to assist you with your routine business obligations, from tax compliance, to paying your staff. With the advent of Making Tax Digital, APIs are now central to the tax and VAT return process. Reduce the burden of tax reporting by submitting financial information to HMRC in one easy move. By automating payroll management, you don’t need to worry about handling staff payments each month. Automate the process, including complex tax calculations.

**Example:** Our integration with BrightPay lets you automate the payroll process by mapping each payroll item to the relevant account. You can manage the payroll, automate payment including tax calculations, publish payslips and more.

In the era of PSD2 and open banking, APIs are helping to shape a genuinely revolutionary new way of working in the financial sector. With the advent of Making Tax Digital, APIs will be at the heart of the tax and VAT return process, allowing financial information from third-party software (including AccountsIQ) to be submitted to HMRC in one easy move.

### USE CASE 4: MANAGING THE APPROVAL PROCESS
Enjoy a smoother expenses approval process by integrating your existing processes with AIQ. Our API can automate and synchronise the approval process, taking the headache out of approval. By integrating your approval system with AIQ, any financial documents you upload to a third-party system, automatically flow into AIQ. This will save you a significant amount of processing time.

**Example:** Our Expensify integration allows you to photograph, upload and record expenses feeding directly into the accounting system. AP automation will allow you to extract the posting data and send the approval journey prior to automated payment. Receipt tracking and expense management, VAT allocation, photograph, upload, and record expenses, feeds directly into AIQ and sets off approval.

### USE CASE 5: WORK AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT
When you integrate your management software with AIQ, you can directly relate your financial data to your work and project goals. Data can flow between systems, so you always have the most up-to-data data available. Plan workflows so that your timesheets fit within your budget goals. Integrations let you simplify the otherwise complex process of business management, both in terms of manual administration and decision making.

**Example:** The integration between AccountsIQ and Joblogic allows an easier and more efficient way to manage finances, combining the benefits of both an accounting system and a powerful service management software.
