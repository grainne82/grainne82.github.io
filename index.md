# About our API

## What are APIs?
APIs are digital interfaces that allow disparate systems to communicate with each other. By integrating APIs into your business practice you can tie together otherwise divergent business processes. 

APIs offer great flexibility in how you exchange data between systems. You can decide on the type of data you want to send or retrieve, the direction of the data flow, and set it all to a schedule.

## Maximise the benefits of cloud accounting
One of the key advantages of using a cloud-based accounting system is that we maintain your data on our servers. This makes it continuously accessible to you over the internet. Take advantage of this accessibility by integrating with our web service API.

Connect AIQ with third-party systems to both:
-	Retrieve data from third-party systems into AIQ automatically.
-	Send data to third-party systems from AIQ automatically.

## API Availability
All editions have access without restriction.

## Accessing Data
The API allows you to access most entity level data. You cannot access customer (practice) level data.
If you are interested in data that our API has not yet exposed, please contact us at [integration@accountsiq.com](mailto:integration@accountsiq.com) and we will take your suggestions into consideration.

## Compatability 
The AccountsIQ system evolves constantly and so does its API. To avoid incompatibilities with our integrator partner applications, we make backward compatible changes. We also offer a mailing list where developers can receive information on the latest bug fixes as well as new methods.
