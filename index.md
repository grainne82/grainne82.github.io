# Overview

## About our API
APIs are digital systems that let disparate systems communicate with each other. This gives businesses great scope in how they tie divergent business interests together. The relevancy of APIs continues to grow in all spheres, including financial.

With the advent of cloud accounting, API integration offers the means to maximise the benefits of cloud storage. Instead of the time-consuming maintenance and potential insecurity of storing data on your own servers, AIQ keeps your data secure in the cloud. With the AIQ API you can access data stored on our cloud servers via the internet. You can access this information from anywhere, increasing collaboration and scalability.

APIs are a two-way stream. They interact with other systems by sending and retrieving the relevant data. As the API is accessing cloud data, you can be assured that you are getting the most up-to-date data available. With AIQ API you can access data such as bank, customer, or supplier details, create transactions, make payments, and much more. You can then use this data in a flexible manner to suit your business needs.

You can connect AIQ with third-party systems to:
- Retrieve data from third-party systems into AIQ automatically.
- Send data to third-party systems from AIQ automatically.
- Retrieve data from third-party systems into AIQ, tailored for the customer.
- Send data to third-party systems from AIQ, tailored for the customer.

## Is the aiq api available with all AIQ editions?
All editions have access without restriction.

## Compatability 
The AccountsIQ system evolves constantly and so does its API. To avoid incompatibilities with our integrator partner applications, we make backward compatible changes. We also offer a mailing list where developers can receive information on the latest bug fixes as well as new methods.

## Feedback and support
